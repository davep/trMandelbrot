# trMandelbrot

A quick and dirty Mandelbrot set for the terminal. Written as an ongoing
experiment with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/).

Likely not a good example of plotting a Mandelbrot Set, or indeed a good
example of a Textual app -- think of it more as a playground to try fun
stuff out.

Expect lots of change over time; don't expect it to be the most efficient
approach -- at least not for now. That's on purpose. This is 100% about
exploring the edges of what can be done with Textual, it's not about writing
a good Mandelbrot Explorer.
