# trMandelbrot

![Evil](img/evil.jpg)

A quick and dirty Mandelbrot set for the terminal. Written as an ongoing
experiment with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/).

Likely not a good example of plotting a Mandelbrot Set, or indeed a good
example of a Textual app. In fact, this really isn't a good Textual app.
That's on purpose. Like, seriously, I'm not kidding, this is designed to be
a REALLY BADLY-BEHAVED TEXTUAL APP! Really. Trust me. This is bad on
purpose. It's designed to test the bounds of what's sensible, and worse.

Like... I wouldn't even look at the code if I were you, it's cursed. If you
look at the code you will never recover.

Expect lots of change over time; don't expect it to be the most efficient
approach -- at least not for now. That's on purpose. This is 100% about
exploring the edges of what can be done with Textual, it's not about writing
a good Mandelbrot Explorer.

Did I mention that this is designed to misbehave and be bad?
