# trMandelbrot

A quick and dirty Mandelbrot set for the terminal. Written as an ongoing
experiment with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/).

Likely not a good example of plotting a Mandelbrot Set, or indeed a good
example of a Textual app -- think of it more as a playground to try fun
stuff out.

As of the time of writing it's very much a fixed view, with a binary colour
choice. The aim is to improve on that over time.
